!Series_summary = Sampada and Sujata are two contrasting genotypes of Papaver somniferum that are contrasting in terms of their latex and alkaloid profiles. The major objective of the present study was to use a small-scale (750 target genes) microarray of P. somniferum for identification of genes that are differentially expressed in the capsule walls of the two contrasting genotypes, Sampada and Sujata. Nidarshana Chaturvedi and Mridula Singh made equal contribution as first authors to this data.
!Series_overall_design = The experiment aimed at studying the expression levels of target genes in P. somniferum. A dual channel procedure with dye-swap arrangement was adopted in the study on two samples - Sampada and Sujata. The interest was to compare the expression levels of target genes in Sujata against Sampada. The expression data was generated on 1,569 probes, which includes controls and target probes.
