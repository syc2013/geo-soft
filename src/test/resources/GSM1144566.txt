!Sample_data_processing = NimbleScan2.6 was used to analyze the data with qspline normalization . The high confidence calls are filtered and merged according to the following criteria: we merged overlapping CNV coordinates across hybridizations to form unique CNV regions using the 40% overlapping threshold as previously described. For cattle CNV calling, we tested the false discovery rate (FDR) in the self-self control hybridizations.
!Sample_data_processing = We selected a set of conservative calling criteria for the final set of high confidence CNVs, requiring that alternations of *0.5* log2 ratios over *5* neighboring probes (0.5_5), under no false positive was found for self-self control hybridizations
